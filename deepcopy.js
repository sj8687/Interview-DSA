// A deep copy, on the other hand, creates a completely independent copy of the object, including all nested objects or arrays. This ensures that changes made to one object do not affect the other. Each object is stored in a separate memory location, making them entirely independent.

// let employee = {
//     eid: "E102",
//     ename: "Jack",
//     eaddress: "New York",
//     salary: 50000
// }
// let newEmployee = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(employee));

// newEmployee.ename = "Beck";
// newEmployee.salary = 70000;

// console.log("Employee=> ", employee);
// console.log("New Employee=> ", newEmployee);
